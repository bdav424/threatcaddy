# ThreatCaddy Fork Patch Notes

**Repository:** `bdav424/threatcaddy` — fork of `peterhanily/threatcaddy`

This document captures every commit present in `bdav424/threatcaddy` (branch `master`) that does not exist in the upstream `peterhanily/threatcaddy` (`main`). The upstream provides the foundational SPA with Evidence/Products, IOC enrichment, CTI surfaces, and basic backup infrastructure. Everything below represents additions, improvements, and new subsystems built on top of that base.
